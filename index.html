<li>At the age of 15, Jordan became more ambitious. He started

created a simple Visual Basic calculator. Both of his projects this
year won the regional fair, and then also won the state fair. <br>
</li>
<li>At the age of 16, Jordan wanted to take his robotics skills to

completely and with an algortithm simplifying the robots movements into
a straight shot throughout the maze.&nbsp;</li>
<li>At Jordan's high school there was no such club for his interests,

pages manually</h3>
<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch
named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page
manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages
support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll
makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to
copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support
and other advanced templating features.</p>
